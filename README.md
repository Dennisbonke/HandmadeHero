<h2>Current Version:</h2>
0.0.2, build: 58.<br>
<h2>Current day finished:</h2>
Week 3, Day 14.<br>
<h2>Compiler Options</h2>
If HANDMADE_INTERNAL = 1, it is a dev build and will include dev / debug code. These might not be stable.<br>
If HANDMADE_INTERNAL = 0, it is a build for public release / shipping build. These _should_ be stable.<br>
If HANDMADE_SLOW = 1, the build is not optimized for performance and could perform worse than expected.<br>
If HANDMADE_SLOW = 0, the build _should_ not include slow / performance hindering code.<br>
Standard compiler options are: HANDMADE_INTERNAL = 1 and HANDMADE_SLOW = 1.<br>
Public release builds should always be compiled with HANDMADE_INTERNAL and HANDMADE_SLOW set to 0.<br>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
Status: Early Alpha.<br>
Main job: Finishing the prototype platform layer.<br>
Currently working on: Debug file IO.<br>
Last completed job: Game Memory.<br>
