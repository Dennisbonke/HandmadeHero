# Handmade Hero
Handmade Hero is a ongoing project where I will be following the handmade hero tutorials by Casey Muratori.<br>
<h2>Supported operating systems:</h2>
This program / game has not been tested on all systems. The plan is that this game will run on a clean install of the operating systems below.<br>
-Windows XP (all editions).<br>
-Windows Vista (all editions).<br>
-Windows 7 (all editions).<br>
-Windows 8 (all editions).<br>
-Windows 8.1 (all editions).<br>
-Windows 10 (all editions, I hope).<br>
<h2>Important notes:</h2>
-This program will NOT work on anything less than Windows XP!<br>
-I love to get bugreports, it means people are helping me! Before issuing a bugreport, please confirm that your operating system is supported!<br>
-All keyboard and joystick controlls are suitable to change at any moment of time.<br>
<h2>Notes / Bugs</h2>
-[BUG] Screen flickers when the resolution is not 1280 by 720.<br>
-[NOTE/BUG] On my crappy coding laptop, the sound is awful to listen to.<br>
<h2>Current Version:</h2>
Version: 0.0.2, build: 72.<br>
<h2>Current day finished:</h2>
Week 4, Day 18.<br>
<h2>Compiler Options</h2>
If HANDMADE_INTERNAL = 1, it is a dev build and will include dev / debug code. These might not be stable.<br>
If HANDMADE_INTERNAL = 0, it is a build for public release / shipping build. These _should_ be stable.<br>
If HANDMADE_SLOW = 1, the build is not optimized for performance and could perform worse than expected.<br>
If HANDMADE_SLOW = 0, the build _should_ not include slow / performance hindering code.<br>
Standard compiler options are: HANDMADE_INTERNAL = 1 and HANDMADE_SLOW = 1.<br>
Public release builds should always be compiled with HANDMADE_INTERNAL and HANDMADE_SLOW set to 0.<br>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
Status: Early Alpha.<br>
Main job: Finishing the prototype platform layer.<br>
Currently working on: Fixing up the sound logic (part 1).<br>
Last completed job: Enforcing an framerate.<br>
<h2>Controlls:</h2>
When using the XBOX360 controller, the left joystick controlls the up/down movement when moving the joystick up and down, when moving the stick left or right, the tonehz will change.<br>
You can also use the D-Pad for this (I hope).<br>
When using a keyboard, the down arrow will move the screen down, the A Key will move the screen to the left and the D Key will move the screen to the right.<br>
Escape will quit the game.
